## Installation

Getting these dotfiles set up on your system is straightforward. Follow these steps to clone the repository and automate the symlinking process:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-config.git ~/.config/my-config

# 2. Navigate into the cloned directory
cd ~/.config/my-config

# 3. Run the automated installation script
bash install.sh
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** Before running `install.sh`, it is highly recommended to review its contents (`cat install.sh`) to understand the changes it will make to your system. This script is designed to create symbolic links from this repository to the appropriate configuration directories in your home folder.

## Usage

Once installed, your applications should automatically pick up the new configurations. For some changes to take full effect, you might need to:

- Restart the specific application (e.g., Neovim, Tmux).
- Log out and log back in, or even reboot your system, especially for display server configurations (Sway, Waybar).

Feel free to dive into the individual configuration files within the `.config/` directory. They are commented where necessary to help you understand and further customize them to your liking.
